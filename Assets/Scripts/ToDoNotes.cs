// I have to make functionality in BorderOptimization and CornerOptimization and much simmilar it's possible and finish things that could be better

// Change Vector3 for MapGeneration to Vector2

// Naming convention for CornerOptimization (need to understand that shit hell again :( )

// Create preset values for finding predicted chunks and use it insted of using gridsize

// Optimization when placing and destroying blocks

// If I'm far from the chunk, then this chunk should disappear and reapear when I'm again close to it

// Save fucking dopici data
